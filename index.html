            <p>Agroforestry </p>
            <p></p>
             <p> This course will walk farmers through how to go about the process' of Agroforestry. For the low price of $21.99 for the course, farmers can achieve a certificate showing mastery in combined farming skills. After learning about how to create a proficient ecosystem in a small piece of land, you will be able to help in the movement against climate change.  </p>
             <p>Permaculture </p>
             <p>Permaculture is a design theory and practice that imitates natural patterns and interactions to produce self-sufficient,sustainable systems. Its main goal is to balance human activities with the environment in order to replenish natural ecosystems and provide necessities like food,housing,and energy. Using renewable resources, increasing diversity, and reducing waste are important.Thus, permaculture createssystems that are long-lasting and ecologically balanced by combining practices like organic farming, water conservation,renewable energy, and community resilience. </p>
             <p>In this course, farmers will learn the system of Permaculture. For the price of $17.99, farmers will be able to gain a certificate in their abilities to balance their environment. After learning how to combine your practices, you will be able to make your farm as efficient as possible in the most environmentally friendly way. </p>
             <p>Biodynamic Agriculture </p>
             <p>Biodynamic Agriculture involves integrating crop farming and livestock farming into one shared system. Biodynamic farms emphasize the relationship between all the different parts of the farm to create an environment more similar to natural growth. Soil on biodynamic farms is healthier because there is less focus on the efficiency of crop growth, and more on the future sustainability of the farm. This method will help prevent major polluting issues like runoff and prevent the creation of non-arable land. </p>
             <p>For only $19.50, farmers can learn the processes of naturally combining crops and livestock into their farms. With the help of biodynamic agriculture, farmers can create viable and naturally sustaining farms that keep the balance of nutrients within the soil and the crops and livestock correct. </p>
             <p>Precision Agriculture </p>
             <p>Precision agriculture encompasses using collected data and analyzing it thoroughly to be able to start taking actions. By taking this data, farmers  </p>
             <p>Precision agriculture involves collecting, analyzing, and taking actions based on data. It can help the agricultural sector meet increasing demand for food products, while also helping farmers improve efficiencies such as through reduced input costs. </p>
             <p>-Leverage advanced technologies like variable rate technology (VRT) and soil mapping to deliver precise amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides, ensuring crops receive exactly what they need.  </p>
